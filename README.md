## Requires Monke Notification Lib

Shows when a user spawns an RPC. Only ones currently detected are: Soda Bubble (Don't worry if the person spawning is master), Projectile rpcs (Slingshot, snowball, ect.) and water splashing. If someone gets reported by Gorilla Not (The AntiCheat) it will show who and why (this includes you, and is only 75% accurate)
